# tvsorter

Python scripts to download TV show thumbnails from TVDB API & rename episode
files based on matching frames from video to thumbnails from API.

## Why?

When ripping DVDs or blu-rays, episodes of TV shows are frequently not in the
correct viewing order. The purpose of this tool is to re-order them correctly
without manual intervention.

## Status

Tool is in very early development stages. Rudimentary functionality is present,
but still requires some manual intervention. Process is also quite slow.
